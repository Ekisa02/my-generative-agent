## Overview

**My Generative Agent** is a Python project that explores the creation and orchestration of autonomous, AI-driven agents capable of making decisions, learning from interactions, and generating meaningful actions in simulated or real environments.

Inspired by recent advancements in generative AI and agent-based systems, this repository provides a foundation for developing, experimenting with, and extending intelligent software agents. The agents are designed to demonstrate core behaviors such as planning, memory utilization, adaptability, and multi-step reasoning.

## Features

- 100% Python codebase for easy integration and customization.
- Modular architecture—extend and combine agent components for new behaviors.
- Memory, planning, and learning primitives for generative agent research.
- Simple interface for simulating agent actions within arbitrary scenarios.
- Suitable for both research and application prototyping.
